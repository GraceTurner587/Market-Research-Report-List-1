<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mechanical Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gelation Hemostats</li><li>Combination Hemostats</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The mechanical agents market is categorized into three main types: Gelation Hemostats, Combination Hemostats, and Others. Gelation Hemostats primarily utilize natural or synthetic polymers to achieve rapid hemostasis by forming a gel-like matrix that promotes clot formation. Combination Hemostats integrate various materials, such as gelatin or collagen, to enhance efficacy by leveraging multiple mechanisms for stopping bleeding. The 'Others' segment encompasses innovative or less common hemostatic agents that do not fit neatly into the first two categories, including novel biopolymers or devices.</p></p>
