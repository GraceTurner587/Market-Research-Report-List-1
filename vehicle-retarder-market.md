<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle Retarder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electric retarders</li><li>Hydraulic retarder</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The vehicle retarder market is primarily divided into two types: electric and hydraulic retarders. Electric retarders utilize electrical components to provide braking force, offering efficiency and reduced wear on traditional brake systems. They are suitable for applications requiring precise control over braking. In contrast, hydraulic retarders rely on hydraulic fluid to dissipate energy and are known for their robust performance in heavy-duty vehicles. Both types enhance vehicle safety and performance by offering additional braking capabilities, particularly in downhill or high-load situations.</p></p>
